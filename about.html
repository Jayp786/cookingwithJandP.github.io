            We are college roommates who now currently reside off campus, with our own cars. <br>
            We are graduating with a computer science degree. It has been a great year for us so far.<br>
            When we were freshmen, we mostly ate dining hall food, which got boring eventually. It was also <br>
            a struggle to get access to ingredients to even make our own food, considering we had no transportation.<br>
            After COVID-19 was over, and UD was finally in person, we got a place off campus, since we had a way of trans- <br>
            portation. While living off campus, we learned to cook and make lots of new foods. If we only knew this much about <br>
            cooking our freshman year, we would have been able to make some great food, with what was available. Since we do have <br>
            an idea now, we wanted to make this website to share those recipes that could potentially help other students enjoy other <br>
            foods, rather than eating at the dining halls all day, or spending money going out.Our recipes contain ingredients easily <br>
            accessible to students without a vehicle or any other transportation to a grocery store like acme or walmart.
